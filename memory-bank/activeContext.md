# Active Context: shopping-cart-infra

## Current Status (2026-04-05)

**v0.2.0 SHIPPED** — PR #24 merged `079a97c5`. ExternalSecret storeRef and Vault KV path fixes are now on main. ArgoCD will pick up on next sync.
**Active branch:** `docs/v0.2.0-post-merge`
**enforce_admins:** restored on main ✅
**Next:** merge k3d-manager PR #60 (v1.0.3) to complete the full ESO + ArgoCD fix chain.

## Current Status (2026-04-03)

**BLOCKED — do not investigate until k3d-manager cold-run gate passes.** Gate: `make down` → `make up` from zero completes with ClusterSecretStore Ready + 3 nodes Ready on a fresh sandbox.
**App pods Degraded/OutOfSync after k3d-manager v1.0.2 `make up`** — 3-node k3s cluster is up, ClusterSecretStore Ready, ESO running. ArgoCD sync shows: basket-service Degraded, frontend Degraded, order-service Degraded, payment-service Degraded, product-catalog OutOfSync/Degraded, data-layer OutOfSync/Missing. Root cause not yet diagnosed — needs investigation when next sandbox is live. Known prior issues: RabbitMQ (order-service), memory limits (payment-service), resource exhaustion (frontend).

## Current Status (2026-03-25)

**PR #22 MERGED** — `7904c8a` 2026-03-25 — RabbitMQ connection fix: `loopback_users.guest = false`, data-layer ArgoCD app with `directory.recurse: true`, resource requests reduced. Copilot 3 findings fixed. `enforce_admins` restored.
**Active branch:** `docs/next-improvements`
**Issue shopping-cart-order#16:** CLOSED — fixed in PR #22.

## Current Status (2026-03-14)

Infrastructure stages 1–3 complete. CI stabilization complete across all 5 app repos. P4 linters merged to main on all 4 linted repos.

## What's Implemented

### Data Layer
- RabbitMQ StatefulSet + Vault dynamic credentials (ESO)
- PostgreSQL StatefulSets: products + orders
- Redis StatefulSets: cart + orders-cache
- Vault database secrets engine (products + orders roles)
- ExternalSecrets for all components

### Application Layer
- Helm chart for all 4 application services
- Argo CD AppProject + Applications (dev + prod)
- CI/CD pipeline: GitHub Actions → Jenkins → infra repo → Argo CD

### Identity
- Keycloak + OpenLDAP deployed in `identity` namespace
- Realm `shopping-cart` configured with `frontend` client

## Pending Work

- [ ] v0.1.0 release branches on all 6 repos
- [ ] Stage 4: Wire observability (ServiceMonitors, dashboards)
- [ ] Namespace redesign (function-centric)
- [ ] Two-cluster split (infra on OrbStack, app on k3s/Parallels)
- [ ] Auth re-architecture (centralise through Keycloak OIDC)
- [ ] ESO cross-cluster (app cluster pulling from Vault on infra cluster)
